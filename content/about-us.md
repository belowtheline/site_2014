# About Us

Below The Line was the idea of Benno Rice who was frustrated with the way
above the line Senate voting was largely opaque to normal voters. The initial
plan was to present the Senate preference tickets in an easier to read format
but that led fairly quickly to the idea of allowing people to prepare their
own ballots for use on election day. 

The site was first used for the 2010 Federal Election. For the 2013 election
the site was almost completely rewritten with the assistance of Michael Pearson.
